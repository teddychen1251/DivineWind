maybe we can have the junctions rotate as the puzzle
add speed run mode
circular maze? and you rotate the concentric circles

maze solving with DFS

I realize now that circular mazes are probably more fun in VR and also maybe easier to implement (I may eat those words)
actually wait rectangular mazes might still be okay
how to solve problem of which junction to choose? make it a skinny Nx3 maze so that
choosing a junction won't give away the general path in the maze (maybe even Nx2 for simplicity)

for more challenge - have multiple maze exits, and one side have faster enemies

maze masking for different shapes and more challenging mazes? like a T formation
or a:
     |
   |    |
      |
so player has to choose which junctions to fix

also look into favoring breaking vertical vs. horizontal walls for better junctions
wall shifts in addition to junction rotates

rotating junctions might be bad after all, since one wall is useless, two walls as well
part of the problem is that the maze is too open, rotating a junction is useless a lot of the time
 - delete less walls in the maze

 put offsets in new maze class

 when you solve the circle, it becomes a twister that blows away the ships!!!
